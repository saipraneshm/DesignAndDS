OO Design principles

1. We encapsulated what varies
2. Favour composition over inheritance:
    In the duck class we just used the references of the fly and Quack behaviours, this is called as composition.
3. Program to interface than to implementation
    In the duck classes we are programming to the fly and quack interfaces rather than dealing with the implementation of the class.


Definition: Strategy patterns define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, makes them interchangeably usable.
Strategy lets the algorithms vary independent of the client that use them.
